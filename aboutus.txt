?WHAT IS A REAL ESTATE EXPERTISE ?

A real estate appraisal is a technical and / or economic opinion, written by a recognized expert, in a formal and official report that engages its own responsibility, to enlighten you and defend you, if necessary in the context of a dispute or a procedure.

The expertise refers to both the knowledge and skill of the expert. In real estate, the expert can, thanks to his know-how, formulate a technical and / or economic opinion. This opinion, which takes the form of a formal report committing the responsibility of the expert, is always preceded by an in-depth analysis. It can be based on observations, a literature search and / or any useful interviews.
